- Before even writing any code, write some more detailed notes on the vision and what this is going to achieve. Maybe do this in the documentation site. 
- Create scaffold for project:
    - Scripts to run formatting/linting
    - Initial barebones app
    - Initial models
    - Initial db migrations
    - Documentation build

- Figure out how to generate an image
- Add models and db stuff to store initial test data
- Generate an image using all the test data, no logic to layout nicely
- Start on logic to change layout based on rules

- Initial frontend setup
- Set up to load the initial landing page

- Deployment setup
    - minimal VM
    - k3s
    - kaniko for building images
    - skaffold for build control
