- Create scaffold for project:
    - Scripts to run mypy/black/isort
    - Initial barebones FastAPI app
    - Initial SQLModel models
    - Initial alembic migrations
    - Documentation build

- Figure out how to generate an image using python
    - https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/handbook/concepts.html#coordinate-system
- Add models and db stuff to store initial test data
- Generate an image using all the test data, no logic to layout nicely
- Start on logic to change layout based on rules

- Initial frontend setup
- Set up to load the initial landing page


- Numpy for number crunching?
- Can use CUDA with numpy
    - Maybe use numpy+CUDA+pillow to pregenerate a load of images for all the different combinations
