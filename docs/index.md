# VITA

Tool to generate example forest garden layouts


## How does it work?

Web app with buttons to generate


MSCW

- random button
- field inputs to change grid, like size or zone/climate type
- show time periods to show different timelines of the plants. First planted / X years / X decades. Trees will outlive most plants. Perrenials last longer than biennial etc.
- Can do grid in CSS
- need a DB containing the different plants/trees and weighting for different plants.
- draw walls and ponds/lakes/water feature. Some plants like walls/shade. Some plants are aquatic.
- needs to be layered. Trees take up lots of space higher up, not so much at the base of the trunk. May also need to show underground, as some plants have tubers or other specific root structures.
- Square grid. Use circles to show plant location and area taken up.

- Decide on the speed of planting and succession stages
- Design windbreak/hedges and edges
- Design the canopy layer
- Design the shrub layer
- Design the perrenial/ground-cover layer
- Design the annuals, biennials and climbers
- Design the nitrogen fixers
- Design clearings, living spaces and paths
