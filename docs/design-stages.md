# Design Stages

These are the chapters in the book:

- Ground preparation and planting
- Growing your own plants
- First design steps
- Designing wind protection
- Canopy species
- Design the canopy layer
- Shrub species
- Design the shrub layer
- Herbaceous perrenial and ground-cover species
- Designing the perennial/ground-cover layer
- Annuals, biennials and climbers
- Designing with annuals, biennials and climbers
- Clearings
- Paths
- Fungi in forest gardens
- Harvesting and preserving
- Maintenance
- Ongoing tasks

Maybe have a page for each with a summary page or PDF generated at the end?

This app is meant to make it easy though, not go into too much detail. Things like paths and clearings should just be autogenerated.

Same with choosing plants, have some simple defaults, then it can be expanded later.
